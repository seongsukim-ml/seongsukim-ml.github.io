Hi, I'm Seongsu.Â Thank you for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹ The spelling of my name in Korean is "ì„±ìˆ˜" and it is pronounced as [sÊŒÅ‹-su:].

I am currently a second-year M.S. student in the AI department at POSTECH. I am also a member of [ML lab](https://ml.postech.ac.kr/). <!-- , where my supervisor is [Sungsoo Ahn](https://sites.google.com/view/sungsooahn0215/home). -->

My research interests include **integrating AI into scientific research and using AI to uncover scientific facts**. Also, I am interested in physical and chemical concepts like solid state physics, simulation dynamics and molecular science, and also mathematical concepts like group theory, geometry and geometrical deep learning.

Recently, I am focusing on **(1) generative modeling for materials** and **(2) *ab initio* method based machine learning for quantum physics and chemistry** related with density functional theroy (DFT) or variational Monte Carlo (VMC).

I believe that AI will effectively reduce the complexity of calculations in physics and chemistry, especially in areas like multi-objective optimization problems, challenges in establishing ansatzes, modeling interactions and governing equations, and handling intractable computations. I am studying and researching these possibilities.

I am always open to discussion, so please feel free to reach out anytime!
